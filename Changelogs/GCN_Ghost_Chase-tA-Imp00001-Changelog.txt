=== Version 1 - [03-12-2024] ===

Initial version.

Consists of a fork from the type-in program "Ghost Chase" as published
in the book "49 Explosive Games for the ZX Spectrum" with the
following changes:

    * Added a section to the beginnning of the program's source code
      designed to provide some basic information about the program to
      anyone looking at the source code.

    * Made some changes the title screen:
    
          Changed usage of the original title of "Ghost Chase" to
          "GCN Ghost Chase" on title screen and stopped it from
          flashing.
          
          Added a bit more information about the program including
          the implementation ID and version number.

          Rearranged the text to be properly left aligned and not
          have random gaps all over the place.
          
          Removed the word "Man" when refering to the player's
          character as the player may not be a man.
          
          Changed the use of "bombs/bomb" to "traps/trap" in the
          game's scenario to leave more room for interpretation when
          developing future versions and/or implementations.          
    
    * Changed the player's controls from [5], [6], [7] & [8] for
      directional movement to [W], [A], [S] & [D] for directional
      movement.

      Also changed the instructions given to the player on the title
      screen to reflect the change of controls.

    * Changed the "GO SUB" and "RETURN" statements to "GO TO"
      statements throughout the source code with the intention to
      avoid potentional overheads created by using nested subroutines.
  
    * Made changes to the way the current score is displayed whilst
      in a game:

          Moved score display to the top of the screen so the playing
          area could be moved to a more central horizontal position
          on-screen.

          Made a change to the code so that the score display no
          longer flashes as it is distracting.
      
          Changed the colours used for the score display area.
      
          The score is now displayed from the very beginning and no
          longer waits for a score to be registered first.
      
    * Made some changes to the area where the gameplay takes place:
    
          Moved the gameplay area to a position on-screen that was
          more center aligned.
          
          Extended the gameplay area width by one tile to make it an
          even number of 24 (24x19) so that it can be correctly
          centered on-screen, not slightly left or right of center.
          
          Tightened the boundary walls to one pixel around the playing
          area. No more gaps that give players a false impression that
          the playing area is bigger than it actually is.

    * Added to the gameplay screen an area informing the player of
      how many lives they have remaining.

    * Made changes to the game over screen displayed when the player
      runs out of lives:
      
          Changed the text "out of men" to "out of lives".
          
          Moved the "out of lives" text to be more horizontally and
          vertically central on the screen.
          
          Stopped the whole screen from flashing as found it annoying
          and worried it could cause seizures. Instead just the text
          now flashes.

    * Rearranged the high score screen.

    * Fixed problem of the high score not being recorded.

    * Added some screens with credits on them which are accessible
      from the title screen.
