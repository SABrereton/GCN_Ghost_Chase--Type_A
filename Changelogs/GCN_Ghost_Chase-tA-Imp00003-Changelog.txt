=== Version 1 - [20-12-2024] ===

Initial version.

Consists of a conversion of version 1 of implementation Imp00002 of
GCN Ghost Chase from being intended to run on Nintendo Game Boy Color
compatible hardware and software to being intended to run on Nintendo
Game Boy compatible hardware and software.

This was done by simply opening version 1 of Implementation Imp00002
in GB Studio 4.X and disabling the "Enable Color Mode" setting.

Editions were then made post conversion where the automatic conversion
process had set graphical assets to colours that were undesired.
