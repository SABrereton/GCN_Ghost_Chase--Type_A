=== Version 1 - [20-12-2024] ===

Initial version.

Consists of an attempted replication of version 1 of implementation
Imp00001 of GCN Ghost Chase using GB Studio 4.X with the resultant
program intended to run on Nintendo Game Boy Color compatible hardware
and software.

The only major changes between versions being as a result of the
smaller screen resolution of the Nintendo Game Boy Color systems.

Although the gameplay area is the same size it no longer fits on a
single screen so must be scrolled through and takes up most of the
screen.

The current score and lives remaining information are now conveyed
through the use of a text overlay at the top of the gameplay screen.

The title and credit screens are now larger than the size of a single
screen so both use a form of scrolling to convey the information they
contain.
