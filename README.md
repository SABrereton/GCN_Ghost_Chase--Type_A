### About this document / Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide some information about
GCN Ghost Chase - Type A.


### About GCN Ghost Chase - Type A

GCN Ghost Chase - Type A is ......

GCN Scalar - Type A is a fork from version 1.02 of "Scalar" by Milan
Babuskov.

Version 1.02 of "Scalar" was obtained from the program's project
repository hosted at the web-based project hosting service provider
SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/ at the time of writing).

Scalar is licenced under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)
and thus GCN Scalar - Type A is also licenced under GNU General Public
License version 2.0 (GPLv2).


### Implementations and Downloads

Implementations are forks of GCN Ghost Chase - Type A. The concept behind
this scheme is to provide flexibility to attempt to "implement" the
same general program using different development methods.

The implementations that have currently been released are as follows:

- Imp00001 - [ Target platform(s): speccy ]
    
    The purpose of this implementation is to predominantly use the C
    and/or C++ programming languages along with the Simple DirectMedia
    Layer (SDL) 1.2.X API to develop versions of GCN Scalar - Type A
    that will run on systems that use versions of the Microsoft Windows
    operating system that run on 32bit x86 compatible system architecture.

    To run the program you will need to obtain copies of the required .dll library files.
    I have made a collection of various SDL 1.2.X and SDL 1.2.X extention .dll library files which should include those required by this implemenatation.
    The collection can by downloaded from it's own repository [Here]( https://github.com/SABrereton/GCN_File_Collection--SDL_1.2.X_for_MS_Windows_32bit_x86).
